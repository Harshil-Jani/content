The HTTP **`424 Failed Dependency`** client error response code indicates that the method could not be performed on the resource because the requested action depended on another action and that action failed.

If a request was issued, and one property update failed (with for example {{HTTPStatus(403)}} Forbidden) then automatically every other property update will also fail with 424 Failed Dependency.
