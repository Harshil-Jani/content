The HTTP **`208 Already Reported`** response code is used inside DAV: propstat response element. This uses Bindings, so to avoid mapping of internal members of multiple binding to a collection inside the request's scope, only one will be reported with {{HTTPStatus(200)}} while other responses for all other bindings will use {{HTTPStatus(208)}} so no conflicts are created.
